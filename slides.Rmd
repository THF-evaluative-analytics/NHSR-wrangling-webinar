## What we will cover today
Session is aimed at advanced beginners and I will assume some familiarity with R and the tidyverse. 

You can find the slides here https://thf-evaluative-analytics.github.io/NHSR-wrangling-webinar/slides.html

### Coding along

No need to code along, but if you want to, here is what you need: 


- `tidyverse`, `here` and `lubridate` packages installed and loaded.
- data from github repo https://github.com/THF-evaluative-analytics/NHSR-wrangling-webinar


--
We will focus on two packages

- Reshaping data - tidyr 
- Joining data sets together - dplyr package

## Packages in R


The first time you use it you need to install the package. 

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Load the package

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

```

## The pipe

Simplifying R code with pipes (%>%)


nested statement
```r
leave_house(get_dressed(get_out_of_bed(wake_up(me))))
```
VS

piped statement
```r
me %>% 
  wake_up() %>% 
  get_out_of_bed() %>% 
  get_dressed() %>% 
  leave_house()
```

## Tidy data

Data comes in all kinds of shapes and forms. We need a consistent way of storing data! 
--

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each cell contains a single value.

# tidyr package

`pivot_longer` - you will end up with more rows
![](https://rstudio-education.github.io/tidyverse-cookbook/images/tidyr-gather.png)

`pivot_wider` - you will end up with more variables (or at least fewer rows)

# Sitrep data

Downloaded data from [NHSE website](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/winter-daily-sitreps/winter-daily-sitrep-2017-18-data/) and saved in R data format. 


```{r}
sitrep <- readRDS(here::here('data', 'sitrep.rds')) # all calls
sitrep_60sec <- readRDS(here::here('data', 'sitrep_60sec.rds')) # calls answered within 60sec

# What is a sensible next step?
We have got a data set. What is a sensible next step? Please go to mentimeter

1. make the data longer
1. make the data wider
1. nah don't bother, it is fine as it is

class: left, middle

## Let's make the data long

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sitrep_long <- sitrep %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols=-c(NHS_111_area_name, year), #<<
    names_to='day_month',
    values_to='calls')
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sitrep_long <- sitrep %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols=-c(NHS_111_area_name, year), 
    names_to='day_month', #<<
    values_to='calls')
```


---
class: left, middle

## Let's make the data long

```{r}
sitrep_long <- sitrep %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols=-c(NHS_111_area_name, year), 
    names_to='day_month',
    values_to='calls')  #<<
```

---
class: middle

Our data is long and easier to work with! 

```{r}
head(sitrep_long)
```

---

Fix the date
```{r}
sitrep_long <- sitrep_long %>% 
  mutate(date=paste(day_month, year), date=dmy(date))


head(sitrep_long)
```

---
Calculate total calls by region
```{r}
sitrep_calls_by_region <- sitrep_long %>% 
  group_by(NHS_111_area_name) %>% 
  summarise(total_calls_region=sum(calls)) 


head(sitrep_calls_by_region)
```


---
Plot calls over time
```{r}
sitrep_long %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarise(total_calls_region=sum(calls, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=total_calls_region)) + geom_point(colour='purple') + 
  theme_minimal() + scale_x_date(date_labels = '%Y-%m-%d') + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, NA), labels=scales::comma) + labs(x='', y='', title='Daily calls to NHS 111')
```

---

You can also go back to a wide format eg after calculating the cumulative sum of calls. 

```{r}
sitrep_wide <- sitrep_long %>% 
  group_by(NHS_111_area_name) %>%
  arrange(date) %>% 
  mutate(cum_call=cumsum(calls)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(NHS_111_area_name), values_from=cum_call, names_from=date)

head(sitrep_wide)
```

---
The `us_rent_income` dataset contains information about median income and rent for each state in the US for 2017.

```{r}
us_rent_income
```

---

```{r}
us_wide <- pivot_wider(us_rent_income, 
                       names_from = variable, 
                       values_from = c(estimate, moe))
```


```{r}
ggplot(us_wide, aes(x=estimate_income, estimate_rent)) + geom_point(colour='purple') + scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0, NA)) + scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0, NA)) +
  theme_minimal() + labs(x='Estimated income', y='Estimated rent')
```

---
# Note!

names_to and values_to from `pivot_longer()` should be quoted because you are creating new variables

names_from and values_from from `pivot_wider()` should not be quoted because you are referring to variables that exist in your data frame.



---
# Things get worse
The `who` data set from the tidyr package shows a slightly more complicated example. 

```{r, include=TRUE}
data('who')
tail(who)
```
---

# Structure of variable names

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tail(names(who))
```


new 

+

method of diagnosis (rel = relapse, sn = negative pulmonary smear, sp = positive pulmonary smear, ep = extrapulmonary) 

+

+

---

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}

who %>% pivot_longer(
  cols = new_sp_m014:newrel_f65,#<<
  names_to = c("diagnosis", "gender", "age_group"), 
  names_pattern = "new_?(.*)_(.)(.*)",

**More rows? Great!**

`bind_rows()` - use to combine different datasets eg monthly gp appointments

Columns with the same variable names will be stacked but check for changes to variable names.



---
More columns? OK this is slightly more complicated but dplyr will be your friend. 

`bind_cols()` - I rarely use it - doesn't respect the order of the observations


If we have a variable (or many) that identify your observations then we can use join functions from `dplyr`. If you know sql, this is your lucky day as the syntax is very similar. 



---
## Mutating joins

A mutating join allows you to combine variables from two tables. It first matches observations by their keys, then copies across variables from one table to the other.

- inner_join(x,y) only keeps observations where in both
- full_join(x,y) keeps all observations even if not in both
- left_join(x,y) keeps all observations in x
- right_join(x,y) keeps all observations in y

Let's revisit the NHS 111 data from before. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}

sitrep_60sec_long <- sitrep_60sec %>% 
  pivot_longer(-c(NHS_111_area_name, year),
               names_to='day_month', 
               values_to='calls') %>% 
mutate(day_month=str_replace(day_month, '_', '-'), date=paste(year, day_month, sep='-'), date=ydm(date)) %>% 
  rename(date_60sec=date)

```

### All calls
```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(sitrep_long)
```

### Calls answered within 60 seconds
```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(sitrep_60sec_long)
```


---

Mentimeter time!

I want to combine the two data sets using the region name and the date. I want to keep all observations, even ones that do not exist in both data sets. Which type of join should I use? 


![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/aeab386461820b029b7e7606ccff1286f623bae1/ef0d4/diagrams/join-venn.png)


---
class: middle
```{r}
sitrep_full <- full_join(sitrep_long,
                         sitrep_60sec_long,
                         by=c('NHS_111_area_name', 'date'='date_60sec'),
                         suffix=c('_all','_60sec')
                         )
```


Worth noting 

- you can add a suffix for any variables that appear in both datasets
- you can join on multiple variables
- the variables you merge on do not need to have the same name

---

## Filtering joins

Filtering joins match observations in the same way as mutating joins, but affect the observations, not the variables.

- anti_join(x,y) drops all observations in x that have a match in y
- semi_join(x,y) keeps all observations in x that have a match in y (similar to inner_join but no columns are added)

---
We have another data set called `regions` with the region, a region code and the area name 
```{r}
regions <- readRDS(here::here('data', 'regions.rds'))
head(regions)
```


---

# Mentimeter time

I want to check that all areas appear in the region file. What join function should I use? 

1. left_join(sitrep_full, region)
1. anti_join(sitrep_full, region)
1. semi_join(sitrep_full, region)

---

We also have a dataset with some areas of special interest. 


```{r}
areas_of_interest <- readRDS(here::here('data', 'areas_of_interest.rds'))
head(areas_of_interest)
```
---

# Mentimeter time

I want to use one the join functions to only keep the observations in `sitrep_full` that also appear in `areas_of_interest` but I don't want to keep any of the variables from `areas_of_interest`. Which statment will do want I want?


1. anti_join(sitrep_full, areas_of_interest, by=c('NHS_111_area_name'='nhs_111_area_name'))
1. semi_join(sitrep_full, areas_of_interest, by=c('NHS_111_area_name'='nhs_111_area_name'))
1. inner_join(sitrep_full, areas_of_interest, by=c('NHS_111_area_name'='nhs_111_area_name'))
